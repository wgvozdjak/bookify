# Bookify

Bookify is a website designed to record, display, and analyze your reading history. While traditional book trackers generally have the power to record books that have been read and give recommendations based on them, many of them are unable to provide any insights about them. Bookify aims to augment these features with a variety of methods to analyze the books that you've read, including information about genres, authors, pages, and time spent reading. Bookify is not yet in production.

Bookify uses the following technologies:
- NuxtJS
- TailwindCSS
- ChartJS
- Supabase

# Bookify

Bookify is a website designed to record, display, and analyze your reading history. While traditional book trackers generally have the power to record books that have been read and give recommendations based on them, many of them are unable to provide any insights about them. Bookify aims to augment these features with a variety of methods to analyze the books that you've read, including information about genres, authors, pages, and time spent reading.

Do note that many of Bookify's features have not been implemented yet, although the base features have (such as book tracking and various statistical displays). Given that it is not in production yet, the database used is often paused, and hence many of the authentication features will fail to work.

Bookify uses the following technologies:
- NuxtJS
- TailwindCSS
- ChartJS
- Supabase
